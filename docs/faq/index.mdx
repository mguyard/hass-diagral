## Errors

### Session already opened

<Accordion title="What is the reason" icon="question">
The Diagral Cloud only accepts a single simultaneous connection for the same serial ID. It is possible that you have another open session that is blocking your access.
This can be through the eOne application that you are using or from which you have not logged out, or another solution using the Diagral API.

`How to solve?`: Disconnect from the other session.
