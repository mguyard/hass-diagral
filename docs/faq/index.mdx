## Behavior

### Required code doesn't match my configuration

<Accordion title="What is the reason" icon="question">
You have configured the integration to require a code only when disarming. However, when you arm your alarm, the code is requested.
This is normal behavior because Home Assistant works this way with its `Alarm Control Panel` platform. Indeed, to detect if a code is required, Home Assistant checks the `code_arm_required` attribute.
If it's True, then a code must be requested. However, Home Assistant is not able to request it only for disarming (at least for now).

Nevertheless, the code is only verified for the actions you have [configured](/integration/setup#alarm-panel-options).
Therefore, if you have configured a code required only for disarming, you can enter any code (even a wrong one) for activation.

## Errors

### Session already opened

<Accordion title="What is the reason" icon="question">
The Diagral Cloud only accepts a single simultaneous connection for the same serial ID. It is possible that you have another open session that is blocking your access.
This can be through the eOne application that you are using or from which you have not logged out, or another solution using the Diagral API.

`How to solve?`: Disconnect from the other session.
