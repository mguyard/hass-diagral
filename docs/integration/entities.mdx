## List of entities

The Diagral integration operates in Hub Mode, meaning that all configurations will be created as devices, and each device will consist of a set of entities.

| Sensor                    | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Central                   | Alarm Control Panel with 3 modes: Away, Home and Disarmed                                  |
| Anomalies                 | Sensor displaying the number of anomalies in state and details in attributes               |
| Active Groups             | Sensor displaying the number of active groups in state and details per group in attributes |

<Info>
All entities are refreshed every `5 minutes` (fixed) or upon receiving a [Webhook](/integration/webhook) from the Diagral Cloud.

## Central - Details

Central entity is an [Alarm Control Panel](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alarm_control_panel/) entity type.
This entity supports 3 modes (Away, Home and Disarmed) and 4 states (arming, armed_away, armed_home, disarmed, triggered)

States :
- `arming`: When the alarm is configured to wait for a specific time before activating (allowing time to exit or enter and input the deactivation code on the keypad)
- `armed_away`: The alarm is fully activated
- `armed_home`: The alarm is activated in home mode
- `disarmed`: The alarm is not activated
- `triggered`: [An intrusion has been detected](/integration/entities#triggered-state)

### Triggered state

The `triggered` state is not a proper alarm state but is activated when receiving an ALERT [webhook](/integration/webhook) (alarm_code 1130, 1139) from Diagral Cloud.
The `triggered` status is only removed when the alarm is disarmed.
When the triggered state is activated, the entity contains attributes (if available in the webhook):

```yaml
trigger:
  group_name: Motion Sensors
  group_id: 3
```

## Anomalies - Details

All anomalies are under `anomalies` key. The first level (e.g., sensor and central in this example) represents the type of element with anomalies. It can be of multiple types:
- sensor
- badges
- sirens
- cameras
- commands
- trasceivers
- transmitters
- central

---

Each anomaly can have several attributes:
- `id`: The unique identifier of the anomaly (internally defined by Diagral)
- `name`: The name of the anomaly (internally defined by Diagral)
- `serial`: The serial number of the element that triggered the anomaly (optional)
- `index`: The index of the element that triggered the anomaly (optional)
- `group`: The group associated with the element that triggered the anomaly. This can be the group name if defined, otherwise the Group ID (optional)
- `label`: The name of the element that triggered the anomaly (optional)

Using this attribute format, you can leverage Jinja2 templates to extract and utilize the information you need.
Below is a quick and simple example for a [Home Assistant Template](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_template/) (replace `sensor.home_anomalies` with your actual entity):

```yaml
{% set anomalies = state_attr('sensor.home_anomalies', 'anomalies') %}
{% for location in anomalies.keys() -%}
{% if anomalies[location]|list -%}
Anomalie {{ anomalies[location]|map(attribute='name')|join(', ') }} on {{ location|capitalize }}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}
```

## Active Groups - Details

<Card title="Example of Active Groups Sensor Attributes" icon="newspaper">
```yaml
unit_of_measurement: active groups
icon: mdi:home-group
friendly_name: Home Alarm Active Groups
groups: // [!code highlight]
  - index: 1 // [!code highlight]
    name: Kitchen // [!code highlight]
    active: true // [!code highlight]
  - index: 2 // [!code highlight]
    name: Stair // [!code highlight]
    active: true // [!code highlight]
  - index: 3 // [!code highlight]
    name: Bed Room // [!code highlight]
    active: true // [!code highlight]
  - index: 4 // [!code highlight]

    active: false // [!code highlight]

Since the attribute format is identical to that of `Anomalies`, the same Jinja2 template type can be utilized.
