The Diagral integration can receive webhooks from the Diagral Cloud, allowing for quicker notifications of important events.
This means that in addition to the regular refresh interval, a refresh can also be triggered upon receiving a webhook of these type :
* `STATUS` : Status change (Armed, Disarmed, etc...)
* `ANOMALY` : A new anomaly is triggered

All Webhook received are propagated to [Home Assistant Event](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_events/) and can be monitor with the event type `DIAGRAL_EVENT`.
