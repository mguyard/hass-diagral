To configure the integration, you'll need your Diagral credentials - the same ones used for the Diagral eOne mobile application.
The `Diagral` integration communicates with the Diagral Cloud.

<Warning>
Please be aware that the Diagral alarm system is a security system, and for security reasons, you may want to consider carefully before connecting it to the Home Assistant automation platform.
Neither the developer of this integration nor the [`pydiagral`](https://github.com/mguyard/pydiagral) library can be held responsible for any issues that may arise from using this integration or the [`pydiagral`](https://github.com/mguyard/pydiagral) library.
Users install and use this integration at their own risk and with full understanding of the potential implications.
</Warning>

## Requirements

1. A working Diagral Alarm system
2. A Diagral box ([DIAG56AAX](https://www.diagral.fr/commande/box-alerte-et-pilotage))
3. An active Diagral eOne mobile application account
4. Internet connectivity for your Home Assistant

## Required Information

You'll need just a few details to configure the Diagral integration:
- Your Diagral username (email address)
- Your account password
- Your system serial ID (from the DIAG56AAX box)
- The PIN code associated with your username/password

### Choosing Your Diagral Account

Diagral provides two account types: master and secondary.
Only one account can be active at a time (whether through API or mobile app).

Master accounts can force connection, automatically disconnecting any active session without notification.
Secondary accounts cannot connect if another account (master or secondary) is already connected.

For better security, we recommend using a secondary account with restricted privileges (as configured in the Diagral eOne mobile app).
Choose your account type carefully based on your specific needs.

### Finding Your System Serial ID

The serial number is located inside your Diagral box.
To access it, open the box and locate a label with a QR code.
You'll find a 14-character code - this is your box's serial number.

<Info>
For guidance on opening the box, refer to the official DIAG56AAX documentation provided with your device.

## Options

You can customize your integration experience through various options.

### Alarm Panel Options

The Alarm Panel options allow you to specify whether a code should be required when using the Alarm Control Panel UI.
You can configure when a code is required:
- Never: No code required for any action
- Disarm Only: Code required only for disarm actions
- Always: Code required for both arm and disarm actions
