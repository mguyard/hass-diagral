To configure the integration, use your Diagral credentials, which are the same as those used for the Diagral eOne mobile application.
The `Diagral` integration uses Diagral Cloud.

<Warning>
Please note that the Diagral alarm system is a security system, and it may be preferable not to connect it to the Home Assistant home automation platform for security reasons.
In no event shall the developer of this integration or the [`pydiagral`](https://github.com/mguyard/pydiagral) library be held liable for any issues arising from the use of this integration or the [`pydiagral`](https://github.com/mguyard/pydiagral) library.
The user installs and uses this integration at their own risk and with full knowledge of the potential implications.
</Warning>

## Requirements

1. A functional Diagral Alarm system.
2. A Diagral box ([DIAG56AAX](https://www.diagral.fr/commande/box-alerte-et-pilotage)).
3. An active account on the Diagral eOne mobile application.
4. Internet access for your Home Assistant.

## Collecting informations

Only few information is needed to configure Diagral integration :
- Diagral username (an email)
- Password associated to username
- Your system serial ID (serial of DIAG56AAX box)
- Pin code associated to useraname/password

### How to choose your Diagral account

Diagral offers two types of accounts: master and secondary.
Only one account can be connected at a time (via API or mobile application).

The master account can force a connection, disconnecting any currently connected account without notification.
If a secondary account attempts to connect while another account (master or secondary) is connected, the connection will be refused.

For enhanced security, it is recommended to use a secondary account with limited privileges (as defined in the Diagral eOne mobile application).
Carefully choose the appropriate account type based on your usage and needs.

### How to find your System Serial ID

The serial number is located inside the Diagral box.
To find it, you need to open the box and look for a label with a QR code.
The label contains a 15-character code, which is the serial number of the box.

<Info>
If you need assistance with opening the box, please refer to the official DIAG56AAX documentation provided with the product.
